# Movie-Platform-Analytics-PySpark-Project
Large-scale movie platform analytics using PySpark and Spark SQL, focusing on ratings analysis, user engagement, and business insights.

## Project Overview
This project simulates a **movie streaming platform** to practice **data engineering and analytics** concepts using **PySpark**.  
It is designed to work with large-scale datasets, dimensional modeling, and analytical problem-solving.
The project uses a **star schema–based dataset** to analyze user behavior, ratings, device usage, content performance, and business insights.

## Objectives:
- Practice loading and processing large datasets using **PySpark DataFrames**
- Apply **Spark SQL** and **DataFrame API** for analytics
- Understand **dimensional modeling (Star Schema)**
- Derive **business insights** from streaming platform data
- Perform **trend analysis** and user behavior analysis
- Prepare analytics-ready outputs for visualization and reporting

## Tech Stack
- **PySpark & Spark SQL**
- **Python**
- **Star Schema (Fact & Dimension tables)**
- CSV-based datasets (1M+ records)

## Key Analytical Use Cases
1. **Ratings by Genre**
   - Average rating per genre
   - Top 3 movies per genre

2. **Device Usage Analysis**
   - Completed vs abandoned movies by device
   - Device usage trends over time

3. **Top-Rated Studios**
   - Top 5 studios by average rating
   - Studio–genre specialization

4. **Actor & Director Insights**
   - Top actors by average ratings
   - Actor vs director rating comparison

5. **Free vs Premium Users**
   - Rating behavior comparison
   - Watch duration analysis

6. **Country-Level Engagement**
   - Top countries by number of ratings
   - Completion percentage by country

7. **Watch Duration Analysis**
   - Average watch duration per genre
   - Genres prone to abandonment

8. **Time-Based Trends**
   - Year-wise rating trends (2018–2025)
   - Subscription-based trends

9. **Movie Popularity**
   - Most-rated movies
   - Hidden gems (high rating, low volume)
